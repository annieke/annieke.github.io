life: 
  My name is Annie Ke. I'm Chinese American and a recent graduate 
  of Dartmouth College. My family immigrated from Shanghai to the Bay 
  Area twice, from 2000 to 2003 (thanks dotcom bubble!!) then 
  permanently(?) in 2008. I became a US citizen in the beginning of 2018,
  beginning my transformation from pragmatically apolitical to aRdEnTLy iNvOLVeD.

interests: 
  At school, clever algorithms (radix sort!) and real analysis made my life 
  simultaneously heaven and hell. Out of school, what I want to learn 
  changes thrice a day, but right now the large buckets are policy, crypto,
  and economics. I feel strongly about fair allocation of resources and fulfilling
  basic human need.
