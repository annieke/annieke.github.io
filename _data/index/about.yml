life: 
  My name is Annie Ke. I'm Chinese American and a recent graduate 
  of Dartmouth College. My family immigrated from Shanghai to the Bay 
  Area twice, from 2000 to 2003 (thanks dotcom bubble!!) then 
  permanently(?) in 2008. I became a US citizen in the beginning of 2018.

interests: 
  After naturalization, I began shifting from pragmatically apolitical to 
  aRdEnTLy iNvOLVeD. I'm most frustrated by socioeconomic inequity 
  and inequality, both in the US and globally. This could change. I'd 
  like to learn more about housing and zoning, market economies 
  and capitalism, and effective ways to halt global warming. At school,
  I loved and hated thinking through clever algorithms (radix sort!) 
  and real analysis.
