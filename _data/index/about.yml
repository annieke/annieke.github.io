life: 
  My name is Annie Ke. I'm Chinese American and a recent graduate 
  of Dartmouth College. My family immigrated from Shanghai to the Bay 
  Area twice, from 2000 to 2003 (thanks dotcom bubble!!) then 
  permanently(?) in 2008. I became a US citizen in the beginning of 2018,
  beginning my transformation from pragmatically apolitical to aRdEnTLy iNvOLVeD.

interests: 
  At school, clever algorithms (radix sort!) and real analysis made my life 
  simultaneously heaven and hell. Out of school, I'm trying to learn more 
  about Chinese history and culture, free markets, and public economics.
  Societal issues wise, I'm most excited by eliminating socioeconomic 
  inequity and inequality, both in the US and globally. This can change.
