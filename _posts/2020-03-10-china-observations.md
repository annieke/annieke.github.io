Self-quarantine reminded me of the long ass list of blogs I wanted to write last summer in China. Instead of writing full blogs, I'll just bullet point the observations I still remember.

+ Tencent's main revenue stream isn't ads, but gaming.
+ My Chinese friends lament that Chinese education doesn't actively cultivate the liberal arts.
+ WeChat public accounts provide the social discourse of OpEds and sometimes even reporting. They can still be shut down though.
+ Chinese national pride stems from historical identity. American national pride originates from founding values, especially freedom.
+ Something something having more kids redistributes wealth.
+ A new frontier for growth helps navigate conflicts (between people with access to the new frontier).
+ Ayn Rand gave me really conflicted thoughts about community service lol
